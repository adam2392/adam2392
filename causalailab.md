# Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Columbia University
__Executive Summary__

At the Causal AI Lab, I am a Computing Innovation Research Fellow funded by the NSF with [Dr. Elias Bareinboim](https://causalai.net). I am working at the intersection of neuroscience and causal inference.

My causal inference research interests are in structure learning and causal estimation in equivalence classes and their relations to neuroscience. Below is a collection of projects, talks, and events I have been involved since my start at Columbia University (to be updated).

Please refer to my personal website for my full CV.
